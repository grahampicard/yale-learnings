    "## Intution\n",
    "Statistical moments are a concept not often discussed in MBA coursework in terms of moments. While we talk about means, variance, standard deviation, and sometimes covariance regularly, we don't often talk about what they mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind statistical moments are that we have a collection of data, and we can identify certain patterns or specifics about the data by performing routine calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132914/what-exactly-are-moments-how-are-they-derived\n",
    "\n",
    "We have four moments we'll discuss: (1) Mean, (2) Variance, (3) Skewness, and (4) Kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "The mean is best describe as the \"center of mass\" off a distribution relative to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "Variance just shows us how spread apart our distribution is relative to the mean. We'll also discuss Standard Deviation, Covariance, and Correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness\n",
    "Skewness shows us how things are distributed to the left or right of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kurtosis\n",
    "Kurtosis is how to close to center is the distribution."
