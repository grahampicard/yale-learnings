    "Bayes' theorem is a way to estimate how likely an outcome is based on specific probabilities. So let's look at our first example: MBA admissions. To get in, you must get interviewed. \n",

    "Let's say we know that we have a $10%$ chance of getting accepted into a given program. We know that only half of people get interviewed. If we receive an interview, we know that we have a higher chance of getting into the program.\n",
